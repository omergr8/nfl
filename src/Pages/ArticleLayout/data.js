    "To qualify as a dart throw rather than a mid-round target, a receiver must have an average draft position after 168. Using that as the cut line means the following players are being drafted, on average, in the last six rounds of 12-team best-ball formats. All but one of the following players is primarily a deep threat. My rationale for selecting this archetype is simple. You’re not looking for consistent week-to-week performance that late at receiver. Rather, you’re hoping for a few spike weeks.",

    "John Brown (WR – LV): 171.57 ADP in 12-team BestBall10s (All Drafts) from 5/1/21-6/22/21  Injuries limited John Brown to nine regular-season ga mes for the Bills last year. Unfortunately, they prevented him from following up a career year in 2019 with a reliable encore. Still, he’s just a year removed from his most productive season, and he joins a Raiders squad looking to replace their most productive receiver from 2020, Nelson Agholor.",
    "Like Agholor, Brown’s a speedster. According to Sports Info Solutions, among receivers and tight ends targeted a minimum of 50 times, Agholor had the third-deepest average depth of target (15.3 yards). Brown ranked inside the top-25 as well, with an average depth of target of 12.6 yards. Further, last year’s depth of target was the shortest of his career, and it checked in at 14.3 yards in his excellent 2019 season.",
    "Brown’s speed should pair well with Derek Carr. Carr’s average throw depth cratered to dink-and-dunk territory in 2018-2019 before surging to 7.8 yards last year, tying for 15th among quarterbacks who attempted a minimum of 100 passes. He was sensational throwing the deep ball, too.",

  quote:
    "He earned Pro Football Focus’s second-highest pass grade on 20-plus yard throws out of 44 quarterbacks who attempted a minimum of 10. Further, his 117.4 NFL Passer Rating on those throws was seventh-best. Drafters are selecting second-year burner Henry Ruggs as WR57 with an ADP of 147.56. I’d rather wait and select Brown more than two full rounds later. ",
